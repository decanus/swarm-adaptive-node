## Rationale ##

## User-Story ##

While a node is still running, I want it to be able to participate in relay messages and content for the network in periods where more bandwidth becomes available. One example of this could be a handheld device with following two conditions fulfilled:

- connected to non-bounded internet access (wifi instead of cell)
- connected to a power source (cpu from hashing for the validator doesn't consume all charge)
