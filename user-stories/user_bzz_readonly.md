title: Light node bzz retrieve
---

## Rationale ##

Some devices and some scenarios come with restriced resources. Simulatenously these devices and scenarios may represent the bulk for end-users for applications building on Swarm. It must be possible to run Swarm with the bare necessities for the application's purpose.

## User-Story ##

I want to run a node that only retrieves data from the network on demand. My node will pay directly for the data it retrieves. I will only store my own data, and will not relay or serve data for others.
