title: PSS incentivized routed traffic
---

## Rationale ##

It should be profitable for nodes to support the pss network.

## User-Story ##

I want to pay the network to relay a pss message for me. The message will have a fully specified address. I need to be able to determine in advance how much it would cost to send the message, which involves:

* Determine the size of the network
* Find amount of hops the message will make
	- For prox sending, this should include the possible neighbor saturation of the message
* Find price for a single routing hop of the message
* Get a refund if I pay for more hops than were made.
