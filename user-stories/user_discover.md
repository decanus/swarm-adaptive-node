title: Adaptive connection guarantee
---

## Rationale ##

Quality of light node operation will determine the quality of experience for end-users of the majority of applications built on Swarm. It is therefore crucial that connections happen quickly and are stable.

## User-Story ##

As a light node operator, I want a guarantee that I can always find a node to connect to in the network, regardless of how much I participate in forwarding messages and storing and serving data for the network.

## Acceptance criteria ##

Guarantees cannot be stronger than guarantees for full nodes in network

## Requirements ##

Depends on incentivization scheme for full nodes to serve light node connections and requests
