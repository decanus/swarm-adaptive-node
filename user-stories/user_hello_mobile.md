title: Hello Swarm on mobile
---

## Rationale ##

Short-term milestone to help inform goal-oriented development

## User-Story ##

As an app developer, I want to be able to easily run Swarm/PSS on mobile and get a basic end-to-end hello world going. This doesn't include connectivity strategies etc, and is expected to be naive.

This user story showcases examples on iOS and Android on how to make use of the compiled Swarm binaries.

## Epic links ##

## Acceptance criteria ##

- Two example projects on iOS and Android that uses the compiled Swarm binary
- Scope minimal end to end: (a) connect and subscribe (b) receive message (c) send message

## Requirements ##

Simple compilation of adaptive node
