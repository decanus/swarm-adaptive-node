title: Light node bzz retrieve and post
---

## Rationale ##

Some devices and some scenarios come with restriced resources. Simulatenously these devices and scenarios may represent the bulk for end-users for applications building on Swarm. It must be possible to run Swarm with the bare necessities for the application's purpose.

## User-Story ##

I want to run a node that both saves data to network and retrieves data from it on demand. I will only store and transmit my own data, and will not relay or serve data for others.
