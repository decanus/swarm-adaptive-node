title: PSS basic spam protection
---

## Rationale ##

Using pss must come at a certain cost so agents, malicious or not, cannot (easily) hamper the quality of service of the network. While a full-fledged implementation can be very complex, this user story is intended to be the first step to inform further development.

## User-Story ##

As a sender and recipient of pss messages, I want to be able to rely on that there are enough resources on the network to make sure my message is received by the recipient.

The cost can be any proof of resource expenditure, but it needs to be cost I can bear. For example, if I don't have a lot of power and computational resource available, I should be able to pay some other way.
