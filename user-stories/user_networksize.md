title: Determine network size
---

## Rationale ##

Cost of using Swarm may depend on the size of the network, insofar as bigger networks increase number of hops traffic will have to make to reach its destination. 

A querible network size heuristic is a basis building block for more complex estimations of network size in the future.

## User-Story ##

As an application developer I want my node to tell me how many nodes there are in the network.

This information should be available on an RPC call.
