## Rationale ##

It should be profitable for nodes to support the pss network.

## User-Story ##

I want to pay and/or provide proof of some cost the network to broadcast a un-addressed pss message for me. I need to be able to determine in advance how much it would cost to send the message, which involves:

* Determine the size of the network
* Find price for a single routing hop of the message
* Get a refund if I pay for more hops than were made.
