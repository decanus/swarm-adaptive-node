## Rationale ##

(Also) necessary for spam protection

## User-Story ##

I want to pay the network to relay a partially addressed pss message for me. I need to be able to determine in advance how much it would cost to send the message, which invlices:

* Determine the size of the network
* Find amount of hops the message will make
* Find price for a single routing hop of the message
* Get a refund if I pay for more hops than were made.
